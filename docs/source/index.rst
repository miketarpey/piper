Piper 
=====

**Piper** is designed to assist with data wrangling tasks using
the amazing `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ package. Piper provides a
set of wrapper
*functions* or *verbs* that reduce the learning curve of using standard Pandas
functions.

Piper functions can be used alongside standard `pandas
<https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ functions. 

When combined within a `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebook script cell
using the piper *magic* command, functions can be linked together to form a
data pipeline.
