Getting started
===============

Installation
------------
To install the package, enter the following:

.. code-block::

   pip install dpiper


.. note::

   Piper will also install numpy and pandas packages and a number of dependent data analysis
   libraries as part of the installation.


Pandas
------
For installing and getting started follow the `Pandas Getting Started Guide
<https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html>`_.

To get the most out of piper, you should at least have followed the `10 minutes to pandas tutorial <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html>`_


Jupyter notebooks
-----------------
Piper's ability to 'link' Python functions which accept and receive dataframe object relies on the the custom Jupyter cell magic command '%%piper'.
Therefore, you will need to install Jupyter notebooks on your machine or have someone install Piper on your Jupyter Hub.

For installing Jupyter notebooks follow the `Jupyter Notebook Quick Start Guide <https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
