# Piper
__Piper__ is a python module to simplify data wrangling with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

Combined with a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook a 'magic' command (__%%piper__), provides an SQL like syntax - similar to R's [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and 
[magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) libraries.

The main functions are:
- select()
- where()
- group_by()
- summarise()
- order_by()

For other _piper_ functionality, please see the [Features](#Features) section.

## Installation 
To install the package, enter the following:

```unix
pip install dpiper
```

## Basic use
Within a Jupyter notebook cell, add the function below to returned for a given dataframe trimmed column text data.

```python
def trim_columns(df):
    ''' Trim blanks for given dataframe '''
    
    str_cols = df.select_dtypes(include='object').columns
    
    for col in str_cols:
        df[col] = df[col].str.strip()
    
    return df
```

In standard pandas, we can combine the new function in a pipeline, along with filtering the input data as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
from piper.factory import get_sample_data

df = get_sample_data()

# Select all columns EXCEPT 'dates'
subset_cols = ['order_dates', 'regions', 'countries', 'values_1', 'values_2']

criteria1 = ~df['countries'].isin(['Italy', 'Portugal'])
criteria2 = df['values_1'] > 40
criteria3 = df['values_2'] < 25

df2 = (df[subset_cols][criteria1 & criteria2 & criteria3]
       .pipe(trim_columns)
       .sort_values('countries', ascending=False))

df2.head()
```

Result:
| dates | order_dates | countries | ids | values_1 | values_2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
2020-03-03 | 2020-03-09 | Sweden | E |	194  |20
2020-05-02 | 2020-05-08 | Sweden | D |	322  |14
2020-01-20 | 2020-01-26 | Spain  | A |  183  |20
2020-02-01 | 2020-02-07 | Norway | D |	344  |21
2020-05-06 | 2020-05-12 | Norway | B |	135  |21

Using piper's %%piper magic command and using piper 'verbs'. Let's import the necessary functions: 

```python
from piper import piper
from piper.verbs import head, select, where, group_by, summarise, order_by
```

Using __%%piper__ magic function, piper verbs can be 'piped' together along with standard functions like trim_columns() using the linking symbol __'>>'__

```python
%%piper
get_sample_data()
>> trim_columns()
>> select('-regions')
>> where(""" ~countries.isin(['Italy', 'Portugal']) &
              values_1 > 40 &
              values_2 < 25 """)
>> order_by('countries', ascending=False)
>> head(5)
```

## Features
- Simplifies working with data pipelines by implementing a set of common wrapper functions.
- Additional wrappers for exporting data to Excel files (using [xlsxwriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/))
- Provide access to databases with support for SQL based scripting and connections.

To-do list:
* TBD

## Status
Project has just started. I welcome any and all help to improve etc.

## Inspiration
Pandas, numpy are amazing data analysis libraries. That said, I'm disappointed that I do not feel as productive in Python in terms of the ease of use of the R language and tidyverse suite of packages.

## Contact
This is very much a personal library, in that its highly opinionated, flawed and probably of
no use to anyone else :). However if it helps anyone else in their endeavours, that would be fantastic to hear about.
